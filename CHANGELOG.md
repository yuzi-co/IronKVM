# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (unreleased)

The first IronKVM release. It is a fork of the official NanoKVM firmware, and
[docs/CHANGES-FROM-OFFICIAL.md](docs/CHANGES-FROM-OFFICIAL.md) lists what it
changes and why.

### Added

- A/B root slots with a recovery slot, and a boot watchdog that reverts a failed
  trial or falls back to recovery.
- Identity that survives a slot switch: the root password, the web password, the
  ssh host keys and `/root/.ssh`. A password change writes itself back.
- USB audio. The board carries the host's audio to the browser over a UAC1
  gadget, because HDMI on this hardware cannot.
- A serial console for the managed host, off by default.
- An update feed of its own, with the official Sipeed server kept as a one-click
  preset.
- A boot-script rollback: an update that stops the board booting is undone by the
  watchdog before it falls back to recovery.
- zram, an HTTP proxy setting, API keys, and a build stamp that identifies the
  running binary.
- `tools/release/release.sh`, which builds, verifies and publishes a release, and
  `tools/abslots/build-card.sh`, which assembles a flashable card image.

### Changed

- The board no longer answers DHCP on the wired network.
- The HDMI receiver is no longer power-cycled at startup.
- Runtime state that used to be written to the boot card continuously now lives
  in memory.
- The About panel shows `IronKVM <version> (based on NanoKVM <base>)`, carries
  the disclaimer, and no longer links Sipeed's support channels. The hardware
  links remain.

### Fixed

- Cross-site request forgery, path traversal and shell injection in the API.
- A password change that did not require the current password.
- A JWT check that accepted the algorithm the token declared.
- A secret key that fell back to a guessable default.
- Updates that were installed without verifying what was downloaded.
- HID that stopped working until a reboot after a USB gadget rebuild.
- A USB gadget that stayed dead for the rest of uptime once its link failed.
  The board keeps answering on the network throughout, so nothing looked
  wrong except that the keyboard did nothing. The server now watches the
  controller and repairs the link, and it counts a link enumerated at full
  speed as a fault, because that reads "configured" and cannot carry the
  gadget.
- A stalled viewer that froze the stream for every other viewer.
- A Japanese Zenkaku/Hankaku key that stuck down on the host. The browser can
  start a composition between that key's own keydown and keyup, and the keyup
  was dropped, so the host kept the key held and this side suppressed every
  later press of it.
- A capture pipeline that reported success after a failed initialisation, and
  that was dismantled while its own threads were still using it.
- A resolution probe that spun forever on an unreadable HDMI input.
- A server that was not restarted when it died.

### Known limits

- **The OLED screen and the Wi-Fi access point still say NanoKVM.** Both are C++
  strings inside `kvm_system`, and changing them would put the whole MaixCDK
  toolchain in the release path and break the documented Wi-Fi provisioning flow.
- **An update installs in place on the running slot.** It is protected by the
  boot-script rollback rather than by a slot trial. Slot-aware updates are the
  next piece of work.
- **The card image needs a card of at least 32 GB and ignores anything beyond
  that.** The partition table is fixed and the data partition is not grown on
  first boot yet.
- **Slot-aware updates are still the goal.** The boot-script rollback passed on
  hardware on 2026-08-16: a board that lost its network to a bad update undid it
  and returned in 367 seconds without needing recovery. It is a repair, not a
  trial, and a trial is still better.
- **Only the English strings are rebranded.** The other 24 locale files keep
  their current text, because a part-retranslated file is worse than an
  untouched one.

# Upstream NanoKVM changelog

Everything below this line is the official NanoKVM changelog, kept as it was.
Which of these releases a given IronKVM build started from is recorded in
`/kvmapp/base-version` and shown in the About panel, because the release script
writes it at build time rather than compiling it in.

## 2.5.0 (2026-08-04)

### Features

* Added an MCP service that lets trusted MCP clients capture screenshots and control the keyboard and mouse with an API key, including a settings page for enabling it and regenerating the key
* Added coordinated device control so MCP, PicoClaw and manual input hand ownership over to each other instead of writing HID input at the same time
* Added remote keyboard lock indicators that show the target machine's Num Lock, Caps Lock and Scroll Lock state
* Added an optional SHA-256 checksum and cancellation to remote image downloads

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed the USB network gadget getting a random host-side MAC on every bind, which made the attached PC register a new network adapter after each reboot; both the device and host MAC are now derived from the chip UID (thanks to [@BeaconCat](https://github.com/BeaconCat))
* Fixed OLED sleep durations above 255 seconds being truncated, so the 5 min, 10 min, 30 min and 1 hour options now behave as selected
* Fixed the mounted image API returning an error in HID-Only mode
* Fixed image downloads and application updates interfering with each other when running at the same time
* Fixed Direct H.264 playback falling behind when the decoder queue backed up, by resynchronizing at the next key frame and preferring hardware decoding
* Added a warning when Direct and WebRTC H.264 stream modes are used at the same time
* Made the video input state shared between processes and read it without shell pipelines, so HDMI status stays consistent between `NanoKVM-Server` and `kvm_system`

### Performance

* Reduced latency in 60 Hz mode with decode-driven flow control, GOP-aware bounded queues, and dedicated writer goroutines with write deadlines so a slow client no longer stalls the others
* Integrated zero-copy H.264 capture into the video pipeline instead of relying on a preload hook
* Stopped HDMI capture when no user is logged in or all viewers are idle, reducing power consumption

### UI Improvements

* Tidied the image download dialog layout and truncated long file names in the upload box

### Localization

* Synchronized translations of other languages according to English

### Chores

* Split release automation into separate package, tag and release workflows, and produced identifiable build artifacts with checksums for pull requests
* Allowed overriding the builder image, installed `patchelf` in the build environment, and fixed the exit codes of `support/sg2002/build`
* Fixed slow container builds caused by uid/gid mismatch and reused existing container users and groups

## 2.4.3 (2026-06-09)

### Features

* Added LT6911D support

### Bug Fixes

* Improved USB network adapter compatibility on Windows

## 2.4.2 (2026-05-20)

### Features

* Added HDMI capture status detection with localized warning and error overlays on the desktop screen

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed left-button touch cancellation and context menu cleanup for mouse input
* Improved the WebRTC loading indicator
* Added Wi-Fi password field validation
* Hardened Wake-on-LAN MAC handling by normalizing stored addresses, avoiding shell execution, handling missing history gracefully, and improving named MAC display
* Stabilized PicoClaw session switching by waiting for gateway release, refreshing runtime status before reconnecting, rendering structured thought messages, and preventing history row overflow

### Performance

* Improved H.264 streaming client handling by reducing frame queue latency, using client snapshots for fanout, applying backend ICE server configuration, and cleaning up disconnected WebRTC clients more aggressively

### UI Improvements

* Refreshed desktop menu ordering and community links, including replacing the Discussion link with Discord

### Chores

* Removed the legacy H.264 stream package
* Updated PostCSS, refreshed the MSW worker, and added pnpm workspace build approvals

## 2.4.1 (2026-05-08)

### Features

* Added DNS management to Network settings, including DHCP/manual modes, effective DNS display, network details, IPv4/IPv6 server validation, and persistent udhcpc hook support

* Added French keyboard layout support and language options (thanks to [@ilyesAj](https://github.com/ilyesAj))

### Bug Fixes

* Hardened HID recovery and cleanup by adding non-blocking HID writes, bounded reopen retries, stale event draining, and release reports after write failures
* Fixed the `kvm_vision` project name and build output message in the SG2002 build script (thanks to [@Voranto](https://github.com/Voranto))

### UI Improvements

## 2.4.0 (2026-04-10)

### Features

* **Introduced [PicoClaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw) support** — an AI-powered remote desktop assistant for NanoKVM. PicoClaw seamlessly integrates a lightweight AI agent with NanoKVM's underlying hardware capabilities. Key highlights include:
  * **Zero-Agent Architecture:** Operates entirely through HDMI video capture (vision) and USB HID emulation (keyboard/mouse). No SSH access, network connection to the host, or OS-level software installation is required.
  * **Natural Language Control:** Features a built-in chat interface allowing users to issue complex instructions in plain text.
  * **Autonomous GUI Operation:** The AI agent can autonomously observe the remote host's screen, understand UI elements, reason about the task, and execute operations mimicking human behavior.
  * **Installation Note:** PicoClaw is not built into the NanoKVM device or firmware. Install it separately when needed.
